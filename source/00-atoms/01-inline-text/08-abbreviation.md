## Purpose

The &lt;abbr&gt; tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "Mr.", "Dec.", "ASAP", "ATM".

*Tip:* An abbreviation and an acronym are both shortened versions of something else. Both are often represented as a series of letters.

Marking up abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
