## Purpose

The &lt;time&gt; tag defines a human-readable date/time.

This element can also be used to encode dates and times in a machine-readable way so that user agents 
can offer to add birthday reminders or scheduled events to the user's calendar, and search engines 
can produce smarter search results.

## Data
